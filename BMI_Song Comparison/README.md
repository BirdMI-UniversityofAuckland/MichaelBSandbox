BIRDMI Correlation Program
==============

This Program simply loads all the .wav files from a working directory containing folders rawsong and bmisong respecitvely.
It then compares these and calculates coefficients using numpy.coefficient, and returns these in an .xls format.
It has been designed with expansion in mind so that additional tasks can be performed and returned to the .xls file in future versions.
Currently v1 only performs a coefficient calculation
