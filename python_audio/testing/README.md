Testing Python Programs
=======================

[back to main page](../README.md)

Due to the dynamic character of the Python language, many potential programming
errors are only detected at runtime.
To find some of them at an earlier stage, you should use *unit tests*,
*syntax checkers* and probably more ...

Unit Testing
------------

[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html) (standard library)

Code Coverage
-------------

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage

But don't try to blindly increase coverage, read this first:
[How to Misuse Code Coverage](http://www.exampler.com/testing-com/writings/coverage.pdf)

Testing Frameworks
------------------

[nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

[py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/)

[tox](http://testrun.org/tox/latest/)

Static Code Analysis
